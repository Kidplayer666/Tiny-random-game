# Tiny-random-game
This is a small game made in Python that has the objective of containing a fire
It needs the following external packages: guizero (please add the dependencies names if added)
There's a Windows installer available on the other branch (untested) that should get you all of the needed dependencies
Any improvements or Feedback are deeply appreciated.
I'm working on a Tkinter version to ensure better compatibility with pure python
Enjoy! :-)
